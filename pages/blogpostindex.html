            <h3><u>December 23, 2020</u></h3>
            <p>
                In October 2018 I spent a brief holiday in Germany. <b>The first day I landed in Berlin and
                immediately made my way to Mauer Park for the weekly Sunday gathering  inlcuding street food, 
                karaoke, and a flea market.</b> After sitting down with a gyro and a beer to relax, I began
                to take in the unique mix of people, sights, and sounds.
                <blockquote cite="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/berlin/articles/famous-quotes-about-berlin-from-bowie-to-kennedy-to-marlene-dietrich/">
                    <em>‘Berlin, the greatest cultural extravaganza that one could imagine.’ -David Bowie</em>
                </blockquote>
                Through the field of people gathering was a man with a small plastic pool (the one that
                can fit a few toddlers at best). <b>Which I thought was strange to have at a park that time
                of year.</b> With kids gathered around, all the sudden he lifted long wands from the pool
                and a slew of bubbles flew off the wands and into the air.
            </p>    
            <br>
            <p>
                I watched for a while as I took in the rest of the scenery. <u>It was a magical day.</u> And out 
                of that trip came the idea to make bubbles as a birthday gift for my newphew. While the 
                surprise gift of bubbling went extremely well (granted it was his 1st birthday), what 
                I didn't expect was for me to continue bubbling as a hobby. It is now part of tradition to 
                bring bubbles when I visit my family, for friends' birthday parties, and pretty much every
                park gathering. <b>While I enjoy bubbling for myself, my family, and my friends, it is most 
                enjoyable to see the magic through the lense of a child enjoying the bubbles.</b>
