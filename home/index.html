                        My inspiration for bubbling came out of an idea for a birthday gift for 
                        my newphew. While the surprise gift of bubbling went extremely well (granted it was his
                        1st birthday party), what I didn't expect was for me to continue bubbling as a hobby.

                        The road to bubbleology is not a straight one. Perhaps round? One day I was
                        cycling through San Diego, and sure enough found myself behind a man cycleing with a bubble
                        machine in tow. After a quick exchange, I connected with him later online. Six months later
                        and he has taken me on as a sort of intern in learning the world of bubbleology. For which I 
                        am grateful.

                        My vision this next year is to take bubbling to the next step. I want
                        to create a persona and entertain groups of people for various types of gatherings:
                        birthdays, concerts, celebrations (COVID-19 permitting). Once I have more gear and
                        create a "show", next will be marketing myself and building my brand. It's silly
                        but why not.
